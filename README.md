🧘 ChillSaathi

Your Mental Wellness Companion Winner of the Internal Hackathon at Ahmedabad Institute of Technology (AIT) for SIH.

📌 Project Overview
ChillSaathi is a comprehensive mental wellness platform designed specifically for students and young professionals. It tackles the growing issue of academic stress and burnout by providing a supportive digital environment where users can engage in mindful activities, track their moods, and connect with a like-minded community.

🚀 Key Features
🤖 AI-Powered Insights: Integrated AI tools to provide users with personalized feedback and wellness suggestions based on their interactions.

🎮 Interactive Wellness Games: A collection of mini-games and activities designed to reduce anxiety and provide a quick mental break.

🤝 Community Section: A safe space for users to share experiences.

Daily Kindness Challenge: A feature that encourages users to perform and log one small act of kindness every day to boost collective morale.

🎨 Intuitive UI/UX: A calming, user-centric design built to ensure a low-stress navigation experience.

💡 The Problem & Solution
The Problem: Many students face high levels of stress but lack a centralized, non-intimidating platform to manage their mental health. Existing solutions are often too clinical or expensive.

The Solution: ChillSaathi bridges this gap by making wellness engaging and gamified. By combining community support (the Kindness Challenge) with interactive activities, we make mental health a daily habit rather than a chore.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Focus on responsive and accessible design).

AI Integration: [Mention specific API if used, e.g., OpenAI or a custom sentiment analysis model].

UI/UX: Designed for high engagement and emotional comfort.
